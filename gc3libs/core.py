    Select and sort resources for attempting submission of a `Task`.

    A match-making algorithm must implement two methods:

    - `filter`: given a task and a list of resources, return the list
      of resources that the given task could be submitted to.

    - `rank`: given a task and a list of resources, return a list of
      resources sorted in preference order, i.e., submission of the
      given task will be attempted to the first returned resource,
      then the next one, etc.

    This class implements the default match-making algorithm in
    GC3Pie, which operates as follows:

    - *filter phase:* if `task` has a `compatible_resources` method (as
      instances of `Application`:class: do), retain only those
      resources where it evaluates to ``True``.  Otherwise, return the
      resources list unchanged.

    - *rank phase:* sort resources according to the task's
      `rank_resources` method, or retain the given order if task does
      not define such method.

        `compatible_resources` method to retain only the resources
        that satisfy the task's requirements.  If `task` does not
        provide such a method, the resource list is returned

    Operations are always performed by a `Core` object.  `Core` implements

        If the task is not expected to produce any output (i.e.,

        to advance the state of ``TERMINATING`` tasks to
        ``TERMINATED``.

        Optional argument `download_dir` overrides the download location.

        The download directory is created if it does not exist.  If it
        already exists, and the optional argument `overwrite` is
        ``False`` (default), it is renamed with a `.NUMBER` suffix and
        a new empty one is created in its place.  Otherwise, if
        'overwrite` is ``True``, files are downloaded over the ones
        already present; in this case, the `changed_only` argument
        controls which files are overwritten:

        - if `changed_only` is ``True`` (default), then only files for
          which the source has a different size or has been modified
          more recently than the destination are copied;

        - if `changed_only` is ``False``, then *all* files in `source`
          will be copied into `destination`, unconditionally.

        Source files that do not exist at `destination` will be
        copied, independently of the `overwrite` and `changed_only`
        settings.

        If the task is in TERMINATING state, the state is changed to
        `TERMINATED`, attribute `output_dir`:attr: is set to the
        absolute path to the directory where files were downloaded,
        and the `terminated` transition method is called on the `app`
        object.

        Task output cannot be retrieved when `app.execution` is in one
        of the states `NEW` or `SUBMITTED`; an
        `OutputNotAvailableError` exception is thrown in these cases.

    Instances of the `Scheduler` class are used in
    `Engine.progress`:meth: to determine what tasks (among those in
    `Run.State.NEW` state) are to be submitted.

    A `Scheduler` object must implement *both* the context_ protocol
    *and* the iterator_ protocol.

    .. _context:  http://goo.gl/SvWWyw
    .. _iterator: http://goo.gl/ue2zje

    The way a `Scheduler` instance is actually used within `Engine` is
    as follows:

    0. A `Scheduler` instance is created, passing it two arguments: a
       list of tasks in ``NEW`` state, and a dictionary of configured
       resources (keys are resource names, values are actual resource
       objects).

    1. When a new submission cycle starts, the `__enter__`:meth:
       method is called.

    2. The `Engine` iterates by repeatedly calling the `next`:meth:
       method to receive tasks to be submitted.  The `send`:meth: and
       `throw`:meth: methods are used to notify the scheduler of the
       outcome of the submission attempt.

    3. When the submission cycle ends, the `__exit__`:meth: method is called.

    The `Scheduler.schedule` generator is the heart of the submission
    process and has basically complete control over it.  It is
    initialized with the list of tasks in ``NEW`` state, and the list
    of configured resources.  The `next`:meth: method should yield
    pairs *(task index, resource name)*, where the *task index* is the
    position of the task to be submitted next in the given list, and
    --similarly-- the *resource name* is the name of the resource to
    which the task should be submitted.

    For each pair yielded, submission of that task to the selected
    resource is attempted; the state of the task object after
    submission is sent back (via the `send`:meth: method) to the
    `Scheduler` instance; if an exception is raised, that exception is
    thrown (via the `throw`:meth: method) into the scheduler object
    instead.  Submission stops when the `next()` call raises a
    `StopIteration` exception.

    The behavior of `Engine` instances can be further customized by
    setting the following instance attributes:

    `can_submit`
      Boolean value: if `False`, no task will be submitted.

    `can_retrieve`
      Boolean value: if `False`, no output will ever be retrieved.

    `max_in_flight`
      If >0, limit the number of tasks in `SUBMITTED` or `RUNNING`
      state: if the number of tasks in `SUBMITTED`, `RUNNING` or
      `STOPPED` state is greater than `max_in_flight`, then no new
      submissions will be attempted.

      If >0, limit the number of tasks in `SUBMITTED` state: if the

    `retrieve_changed_only`
      If both this and `overwrite` are ``True``, then only changed
      files are downloaded. See `Core.fetch_output`:meth: for details.
